Code Explanation - Calculating Total Price and Item Breakdown

The provided code calculates the total price and item breakdown for a list of items. Let's explain the code step by step:

Function: calculatePrice5(items)

1.The calculatePrice5 function takes an array items as input, representing the list of items to calculate the price for.

2.It initializes the total_price variable to 0.0 and creates an empty array breakdown to store the breakdown information for each item.

3.The function then iterates over each item in the items array using a for loop. For each item:

- It extracts the name, price, and quantity properties from the item object.-
- It calculates the item_total by multiplying the price and quantity of the item.-
- It calculates the tax by multiplying the item_total with the tax rate of 0.0725 (7.25% tax rate).-
- It calculates the item_total_with_tax by adding the item_total and tax together.-
- It pushes an object containing the item's breakdown information (name, quantity, price, tax, and total_with_tax) into the breakdown array.-
- It updates the total_price by adding the item_total_with_tax to it.

4.After iterating through all the items, the function returns an object with properties breakdown and total_price.

Printing the Result

The code creates an array of items containing three objects representing different items with their respective prices and quantities.

1.It calls the calculatePrice5 function with the items array and assigns the result to the result variable.

2.It then prints the item breakdown and total price using console.log() statements.

- For each item in the result.breakdown array, it prints the name, quantity, price, tax, and total with tax.
- Finally, it prints the total price.
