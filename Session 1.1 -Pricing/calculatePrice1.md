Code Explanation - Drink Price Calculation 1

This code defines several enumerations and a function for calculating the price of a drink based on its type, size, and additional toppings. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

Enumerations:

1. DrinkType: This enumeration represents different types of drinks and has three values: "hot", "cold", and "blended".
2. Size: This enumeration represents different sizes of drinks and hass three values: "S" (small), "M" (medium), and "L" (large).
3. PriceAdjustment: This enumeration defines various price adjustments for different aspects of the drink, such as size, blend, and whipped cream topping. Each adjustment is represented by a constant value.


Function: calculatePrice1(drinkType, size, whippedCream): 
1. This function takes three parameters: drinkType (representing the type of drink), size (representing the size of the drink), and whippedCream (a boolean 2. 2.2.indicating whether whipped cream is added as a topping). The function calculates and returns the price of the drink.
2. The function begins by initializing the basePrice variable with the value of PriceAdjustment.BASE, which is 2.
Next, it adjusts the base price based on the size of the drink using a switch statement. If the size is "M" (medium), it adds the value of PriceAdjustment.SIZE_M (0.5) to the base price. If the size is "L" (large) and the drink type is either "cold" or "blended", it adds the value of PriceAdjustment.SIZE_L (1) to the base price.
3. Then, it adjusts the base price based on the drink type using a switch statement. If the drink type is "blended", it adds the value of PriceAdjustment.BLENDED (1) to the base price.
4. Finally, it adjusts the base price if whipped cream is added as a topping by adding the value of PriceAdjustment.WHIPPED_CREAM (0.5) to the base price.
The function returns the final calculated basePrice.
